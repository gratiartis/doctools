With a global team of over 40 investment professionals across Zurich, New York and Tokyo, AFS offers commingled and customised FoHF portfolios through its FoHF platform, as well as advisory services.

AFS research team is led by two research heads: Kelsey Deshler and Yung-Shin Kung. Deshler manages a team of five focused on event-driven, distressed and equity L/S, with three research analysts in New York, two in Zurich and a shared researcher based in Tokyo. Kung and his team cover relative value and tactical trading strategies. Both research heads are members of the investment committee that also includes the head and CIO of AFS, Ulrich Keller. The investment committee meets twice a year to decide on strategy allocation but portfolios can be rebalanced in between of those meetings as the committee meets each month to review portfolios and to approve the bottom-up list of funds.

AFS manages more than USD 9.4bn in assets where around USD 4.5bn of this is in custom multi-manager programs. AFS offers a range of investment solutions. Within the multi-strategy solutions, there are two fund of fund portfolios. CSPST (Lux) Multi-Strategy was launched in 2004 and managed by Oliver Wiedemeijer. CSPST (Lux) Global Equities Long/Short was launched in 1999 managed by Stephane Julen. The group's UCITS offerings are made up of the FoHF CS Prima Multi-Strategy (launched in 2010) and CS Prima Growth (launched in 2011). The aim of these funds is to generate risk-adjusted returns.

At the same time, AFS manage several customised mandates (approx. USD 100mn per mandate) for institutional investors, both multi-strategy portfolios, and style specific portfolios. Advisory services include strategic allocation, manager selection, due diligence and portfolio construction. In some cases, the advisory services are more of partnerships where AFS attend meetings together with their clients to meet fund managers. In all advisory mandates, clients can also choose to get access to an approved list of around 100 premier funds out of the main approved list. AFS has 120+ Hedge Funds approved for investment and actively follows 500+ on an on-going basis. 

When selecting new managers each of the three group heads (investment, operations, and risk) can veto when a new fund is presented to the investment committee. Investments are made globally across all strategies including specialised managers. In the US, they are biased to lower net-exposed managers as they find the beta component of returns diminishing, while in Europe they also prefer alpha focused managers. For Asia, they prefer opportunistic managers in order to take advantage of the regions changing market dynamics. There are no track record requirements as Credit Suisse often invests in early-stage managers, while in these situations they expect preferred terms in return.</p><h2>Notes</h2><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;text-align:justify;">In June 2015, the investment committee was keen on equity L/S, which the company divides into three categories: low net exposure, opportunistic exposure and structurally long-biased managers that manage more beta. In terms of event driven strategies, they prefer investing with long-biased managers who are more special situations and event driven oriented rather than activist oriented. AFS is also focusing on new UCITS feeders that have lower fees.</p><div id="investor_details"><h2>Details</h2><p>Investor Type: Fund of Hedge Fund</p><p>Investor Status: Live Investor Seeking To Change Portfolio</p><p>Size of HF Allocation: $10500m</p><h3>Hedge Fund Strategy Preference</h3><p>Liquidity: Monthly</p><p>Investment structure: Hedge Fund Direct</p><h3>Strategies</h3><ul><li>AIFMD Compliant</li><li>Activist</li><li>Asia</li><li>Commodities</li><li>Convertible Arbitrage</li><li>Credit Long Short</li><li>Currency FX</li><li>Distressed</li><li>Emerging Managers</li><li>Emerging Market Debt</li><li>Emerging Market Diversified</li><li>Emerging Market Equity</li><li>Equity Long Short</li><li>Equity Market Neutral</li><li>Europe</li><li>Event Driven</li><li>Fixed Income</li><li>Fixed Income Arbitrage</li><li>Global</li><li>HF Direct</li><li>Long Bias</li><li>Macro</li><li>Managed Futures CTA</li><li>Multi-strategy</li><li>Niche</li><li>North America</li><li>Opportunistic</li><li>Relative Value</li><li>Special Situations</li></ul></div></div></body></html>
